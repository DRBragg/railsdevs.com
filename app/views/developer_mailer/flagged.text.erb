Hey <%= @developer.name %>,

I'm Joe, the founder of railsdevs (<%= root_url %>). Your developer profile (<%= developer_url(@developer) %>) was flagged because it doesn't contain enough information and kind of looks like spam.

I've set your profile to invisible. No one but yourself is able to see it. You can toggle this back to visible after you add more details to your profile.

Thanks,
Joe
